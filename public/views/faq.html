    <strong>What is "estate planning"? Is it only for the wealthy?</strong><br>
<br>
    <p>At first blush, the term "estate planning" might seem to indicate services required by people perceived to be "wealthy" -  those relatively few who have "estates".  But, it is simply the process whereby families and individuals take control of their personal affairs to counsel and consult with professional advisors who know them, including their personal attorney, investment advisor or financial planner, accountant or tax preparer, life insurance professional, and others to coordinate their goals and concerns for themselves and their loved ones with their property and assets. Estate planning may focus on the transfer of property ownership at death or the management and disposition of property during a time of disability. At some level, it is important for every American who owns a bank account, IRA, real estate, or other account or item. It may be as fundamental as identifying the guardian of a minor child. The basic and core legal document that most people associate with estate planning is a Last Will and Testament. Especially these days, however, health care surrogate documents, declarations about life support, and trusts are often important as well.</p>

    <strong>What happens to my "estate" in Kansas if I die without a will or trust?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      If you die without a valid will or trust, "one size fits all" statutes passed by the Kansas legislature will stand in your shoes to determine your heirs and how they will receive ownership of your property or assets.  It is important to note the emphasis on the word "valid"; much expensive and disruptive litigation following a person's death results because some part of a signed will turns out not to be "valid" under state law. The defect could be as simple as a notary public or witness forgetting to sign his or her name in one of the required places, or perhaps that not all the witnesses were actually in the room at the time of your own signing, or that the "self proving affidavit" was not properly completed. To some people this may seem that "legal technicalities" are excessively controlling. But, this is the legislature's way of trying to protect the intentions of the deceased person who can no longer explain things for himself or herself. So it is important to be cautious and deliberate in seeking the assistance of counsel:  The person who is planning his or her estate is never around to see how things turn out.

<strong>Do I need a will to avoid probate court?</strong>
<br>
<br>
<p>
A will does not prevent a person's estate from going to probate court.   Legally, the whole purpose of a will is to guide the probate judge in distributing the person's property after death, ideally according to what the deceased person's wishes were.  A will may also nominate a person for the judge to appoint as (1) Personal Representative ("Executor"), (2) Guardian for the personal care of minor children or dependants, and (3) Conservator of a minor or disabled person's inheritance.

<br>
<strong>If I have no will, does my property go to the government after I die?</strong>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Not generally. A person who dies without a Will is said to have died "intestate" -- without testimony about their desires.  In that situation, the probate court follows the State's intestacy statutes as explained above.  To understand these rules it is important to understand your family tree and next of kin to the 6th degree. But, if you have no heirs within that degree, or your heirs cannot be located, your property could be escheated to the state.  Generally, if you want any control over what happens to your property after you die, you should prepare estate planning documents, because the intestacy statutes rarely do what you want them to do.

<strong>Can I prepare my will by myself, without a lawyer?</strong>
<br><br>
<p>
Of course there are kits and internet sites that may help you prepare your own document.  However, we urge you not to avoid legal counsel.  You will never see the result of your own estate planning.  Too many technicalities exist for you to assume that off-the-shelf software will take into account the special rules of your jursidiction and the changes in the law that may occur by the time of your death.   Ever-changing statutes govern everything from the precise way the document is signed  to the specific language of the document. The personal counsel and advice of your lawyer can avoid these legal snafus and protect your desires for your property.

<strong>Non-Probate Property</strong>
<br><br>
<p>
Even if you do have a valid will at the time of your death, it may not be useful to determine the heirs and beneficiaries of all your property since, by law, it may only govern the disposition of property/assets owned by you in your sole name at the time of your death. For example, your will cannot dictate what happens to the following types of property or asset ownership:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Joint ownership with another person, with rights of survivorship.</li>

<li>Trust ownership.</li>

<li>Governed by proper beneficiary desgnation contracts, such as (1) retirement plans, (2) annuities, and (3) life insurance.  A common flaw, however, occurs when such contracts are not regularly maintained and updated, or even filled out by the owner.  In such cases, a former spouse may be unintentionally benefited upon the death of the owner, or the default languge of the contract directs the benefit to the "estate of the deceased".  In the latter of those examples, a probate estate may have to be opened - leading to results possibly not anticipated by the deceased person.</li>

<li>Property governed by "beneficiary deeds" including appropriate "pay on death" or "transfer on death" provisions.
</li>
</ol>
